# Python Regular Expressions (Regex)

This repository explains the basics of Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python in a simple and beginner-friendly way.

The purpose of this project is to help understand what regex is, why it is useful, and where it is commonly used in real-world applications.

---

## What is a Regular Expression?

A Regular Expression (Regex) is a pattern used to search, match, extract, validate, or replace text.

In simple terms, regex helps you find specific information inside a string.

---

## Why Use Regex?

Regular Expressions are useful for:

- Cleaning and formatting text data
- Validating user inputs such as emails, phone numbers, and passwords
- Extracting useful information from large text
- Replacing or modifying text efficiently

---

## Python and Regex

Python provides a built-in module called `re` that allows working with regular expressions easily.

Using this module, you can:
- Search for patterns in text
- Validate text formats
- Extract specific parts of strings
- Modify or clean text data

---

## Concepts Covered in This Project

This project covers the following regex concepts:

- Pattern matching
- Character types such as letters, digits, and spaces
- Repetition rules (how many times something appears)
- Start and end position matching
- Word boundaries
- Conditional matching using lookarounds

---

## Practice Tasks Included

The repository explains regex usage for tasks such as:

- Finding digits and words in text
- Extracting emails, URLs, domains, and hashtags
- Validating phone numbers, usernames, and PIN codes
- Checking strong passwords
- Extracting dates, years, prices, and IP addresses
- Detecting duplicate words
- Removing HTML tags
- Parsing log messages
- Normalizing extra spaces

All tasks are based on real-world examples.

---

## Strong Password Rules (Explained)

A strong password should:

- Be at least 8 characters long
- Contain at least one lowercase letter
- Contain at least one uppercase letter
- Contain at least one digit
- Contain at least one special character

Regex allows checking all these rules at once.
